            1: "Welcome to the online administration interface for multiplayer servers running Valve Corporation's Source engine. The website offers several powerful and easy-to-use tools to easily manage your servers. It is compatible with popular games like <strong>Garry's Mod</strong>, <strong>Minecraft</strong> et <strong>Counter-Strike : Global Offensive</strong>!"
            2: "Unlike other competing solutions, this website allows you to use the RCON communication protocol without interruption and in a fast and easy way. Additionally, the website has several optimizations to reduce access and loading times, which are traditionally long with the most famous hosts."
            3: "The RCON communication protocol is subject to several modifications and updates every year to improve the performance of interactions between third parties (us) and the remote API used on game servers. As a result, all current solutions are sometimes rendered obsolete or out of service for months or even years as creators need to revise their communication tools. This website uses new ways to be practically independent from updates and to be able to continue to work despite major changes made by Valve."
            4: "Thanks to the use of modern, high-performance RCON communications tools, end-to-end security and encryption of data transmitted and received by the website is now possible. Any sensitive information you may enter will be automatically encrypted using a military-grade algorithm. We never store passwords in clear text, never."

    answer:
        1: "Registration on the website is done on the home page of the website. On this page, you will find the presentation of the functionalities as well as a way to proceed to your registration and connection. Registration is done in two steps: first you have to fill in your personal information in order to create a user account, then you will be asked to fill in information about one of your game servers. This information will then be processed for display on the dashboard."
        2: "When you register on the website, your account is automatically set up as a regular user and you already have a number of features available to you. However, if you make a one-off donation of any amount you wish, you will be able to unlock additional benefits and features to enhance your user experience."
        3: "The current site and the competing sites have several differences. Firstly, the competing sites cannot be accessed without a user account and without having already purchased a service from their infrastructure. This means that access to their administration panel depends on a subscription to their services, so our site is completely free of charge. The second is that our site uses the latest versions of communication between our servers and your infrastructure to facilitate the speed of execution of all your actions."
    question:
        1: "How do I register on the website?"
        2: "What are the benefits for donator users?"
        3: "What is the difference between the current website and the competitors?"
    description: "The user support page is the most important page for all users who may encounter problems while using or navigating through the entire website. It also provides additional guidance to improve the overall user experience."
